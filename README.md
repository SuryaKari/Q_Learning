# Learning to Q

This repository will host all my trials on Deep Reinforcement learning

## Project 1 : Simple Q Learner

This simple Q learner is an implementation of the article http://mnemstudio.org/path-finding-q-learning-tutorial.htm
I created a python version of the article for everyone to take a look at.
